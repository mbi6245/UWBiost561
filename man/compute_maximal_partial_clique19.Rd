\title{Compute the Maximal Partial Clique in an Adjacency Matrix}
\usage{
compute_maximal_partial_clique19(adj_mat, alpha = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_mat}{A symmetric adjacency matrix representing the graph, where the matrix is n x n, contains
only 0s and 1s, has 1s on its diagonal, and lacks row or column names. The matrix size must be between 5
and 50 nodes inclusive.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0.5 and 1 inclusive, specifying the minimum required edge density
within the clique as a proportion of a fully connected clique.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements: \code{clique_idx}, a numeric vector listing the indices of the nodes
that form the maximal partial clique, and \code{edge_density}, the actual edge density within this clique. The
edge density is computed as the number of existing edges divided by the number of possible edges among
the nodes in the clique.
}
\description{
This function evaluates an adjacency matrix to identify the largest set of nodes that forms a partial clique,
meeting a specified edge density threshold. It searches for the largest group of nodes where the internal
connectivity meets or exceeds a given proportion of the maximum possible edges (alpha). The search is
exhaustive, checking all possible combinations of nodes to ensure the largest possible clique is found
that satisfies the density requirement. This method is computationally intensive but thorough, intended to
provide the best possible clique under given constraints.
